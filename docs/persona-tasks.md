# Step-by-Step: Implementing an AI Avatar Feature

Below is a high-level set of instructions for creating an AI “digital twin” or avatar feature that can represent a user in conversations. This feature will use LangChain, Pinecone, and OpenAI to (1) capture a user’s chat history, (2) build a “persona,” and (3) allow other users to interact with that persona as if it were the user themselves.

---

## 1. Database Considerations

1. Decide how you will store the user’s “persona” data:
   - Option A: Add columns to your existing “users” table.  
     - E.g., add columns like “persona_profile_text,” “persona_settings,” etc.
   - Option B: Create a new table, e.g. “user_personas.”  
     - This table could store:
       • user_id (references users.id)  
       • persona_name  
       • persona_description or style data  
       • persona_vector_data (optional if embedding user’s style references)  
       • created_at, updated_at  

   For flexibility and cleaner organization, Option B (a dedicated table) is often preferred, especially if you foresee storing more detailed persona data or multiple personas per user.

2. Create or modify the needed schema:
   - If using a new table, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_personas (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    persona_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    persona_description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_persona_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
        NEW.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
        RETURN NEW;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_persona_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON user_personas
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_persona_updated_at();
```

## 2. Package & Library Setup

In your server, you likely already have:
- "@langchain/openai"
- "@langchain/pinecone"
- "@pinecone-database/pinecone"
- "dotenv"
- "express"
- "node-fetch"
- "supabase" (from @supabase/supabase-js)

If any are missing, install them in the server directory:

```bash
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/pinecone @pinecone-database/pinecone dotenv node-fetch
```

For the client side (if you want direct client integration with OpenAI or any specialized interactions):
```bash
npm install @langchain/react
```
(Though typically most AI calls happen on the server.)

---

## 3. Collecting User Chat History to Form the Persona

1. Write a service function to retrieve all messages by a given user. For example, in your RagService or a new “personaService”:

```javascript
// pseudocode
async function fetchUserMessages(userId) {
  const { data: messages, error } = await supabase
    .from('messages')
    .select('*')
    .eq('sender_id', userId);

  if (error) throw error;
  return messages;
}
```

2. Concatenate or summarize all of these messages into a textual representation of how the user typically writes. You can then generate a “persona profile” by summarizing:
   - Key words or phrases the user commonly uses 
   - Tone (informal, formal, humorous, technical, etc.)  
   - Common topics

3. Store the summarized persona text in “user_personas” (or whichever approach you choose) as “persona_description” or “style_summary.”

---

## 4. Creating an Avatar with LangChain + Pinecone

### 4.1. Embedding the Persona

1. Generate embeddings for the user’s aggregated style or persona text.  
   - The aggregated style text might be something like “This user typically writes in short, informal sentences, uses emojis, and discusses DevOps topics.”  
2. Upsert those embeddings into Pinecone so you can query them later when generating persona-based responses.

```javascript
// Example pseudo-code for embedding the persona text
async function embedPersona(personaDescription, personaId) {
  const vector = await embeddings.embedQuery(personaDescription);
  // Upsert to Pinecone
  await pineconeIndex.upsert([
    {
      id: `persona_${personaId}`,
      values: vector,
      metadata: {
        persona_id: personaId,
        text: personaDescription
      }
    }
  ]);
}
```

### 4.2. Generating Responses as the Persona

When another user chats with the AI avatar, you can:

1. Retrieve the persona’s stored text or vector from Pinecone.  
2. Combine it with the conversation context (the user’s question or message).  
3. Construct a prompt that instructs the model “Respond as this user would, using their style and content references.”

Using LangChain’s ChatOpenAI:

```javascript
async function respondAsPersona(userQuery, persona) {
  const personaVector = /* fetch from Pinecone or from memory */;
  // Optionally retrieve similar style docs
  // Then build your prompt
  const messages = [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `
        You are the digital twin of ${persona.persona_name}.
        The following text describes how they speak and think:
        "${persona.persona_description}"
        Respond to the user’s message as they would, preserving their style and tone.
      `
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: userQuery
    }
  ];

  const response = await chatOpenAI.invoke(messages);
  return response.content;
}
```

---

## 5. Enabling Other Users to Chat with the AI Persona

1. Create a dedicated endpoint for “chat with this user’s AI persona,” e.g.:
   - POST /api/ai/avatars/:personaId/chat

2. This endpoint would:
   - Validate that the persona exists (fetch from DB or user_personas).  
   - Take the incoming message from the request body.  
   - Call “respondAsPersona()” with that message.  
   - Return the AI’s response to the requester.

3. On the frontend, add a UI button or route so that any user can open a “DM with the AI Avatar” (or a special channel representing that persona). For example:
   - “profile page” -> “Chat with AI twin”

---

## 6. Context Awareness

If you want the AI avatar to reference the user’s prior messages beyond just style, you can incorporate the user’s entire message embeddings from Pinecone. For instance:

1. Use a similarity search on the user’s historical messages (already embedded in Pinecone) to find the user’s content that matches the incoming question.  
2. Provide that content to the LLM as additional context so it can answer “like the user,” referencing actual details from that user’s chat logs.

Pseudocode:

```javascript
// 1. Query Pinecone for relevant user messages
const similarUserMessages = await pineconeIndex.query({
  vector: await embeddings.embedQuery(userQuery),
  topK: 5,
  includeMetadata: true,
  filter: { senderUsername: "theUserBeingImitated" } // or userId
});

// 2. Build final prompt with style + previously found messages
const messages = [
  {
    role: 'system',
    content: `
      You are the digital twin of ${username}.
      Persona/style info: "${personaDescription}"
      The following are some of ${username}'s recent or relevant messages:
      ${similarUserMessages.matches.map(match => match.metadata.content).join('\n')}
      Use these as context for your answer.
    `
  },
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: userQuery
  }
];
```

---

## 7. Recommended Table/Field Layout

Below is a sample layout if you choose a dedicated table:

• **user_personas**:  
  - **id** (UUID)  
  - **user_id** (UUID references users.id)  
  - **persona_name** (TEXT)  
  - **persona_description** (TEXT) — summarized or curated style text  
  - **created_at** (TIMESTAMP)  
  - **updated_at** (TIMESTAMP)

You could also add:
- persona_settings (JSONB for config info, e.g., voice settings, style toggles, etc.)
- persona_embedding_id or vector references

---

## 8. Putting It All Together

1. **Create the persona**:
   - Summarize user’s chat history → store persona description in user_personas.  
   - Generate an embedding for “persona_description” → upsert to Pinecone.  

2. **Expose endpoints**:
   - A “GET /api/personas/:userId” to retrieve or create the user’s persona.  
   - A “POST /api/personas/:personaId/chat” to send a message to the AI avatar.  

3. **UI Implementation**:
   - Add a button to a user profile or a special interface: “Chat with AI Twin.”  
   - On click, your client calls the “POST /api/personas/:personaId/chat” with the user’s input.  
   - Display the returned AI message in a chat-like interface.  

4. **Enhance with context**:
   - Use the user’s Pinecone-embedded messages to reference real conversation context.  
   - The AI persona will not only match style but also remember details the user has shared.  

5. **Testing**:
   - Ensure that messages are sufficiently capturing the user’s style.  
   - Test for edge cases, error handling, and rate-limit usage with the OpenAI API.

## 9. Beyond Text — Potential Additional Features

- **Voice Synthesis**: Use a service like D-ID or HeyGen to generate audio or video.  
- **Persona Customization**: Let users choose from style presets or refine their persona’s voice.  
- **Privacy Controls**: Users might allow or disallow others to chat with their avatar.

## 10. Conclusion

By following these steps—adding a new table (or columns) for the persona, aggregating user messages, summarizing style, embedding it in Pinecone, and exposing a “chat with the AI persona” endpoint—you can create a robust AI digital twin. This avatar can maintain the user’s style using LangChain + OpenAI while referencing historical context from Pinecone-embedded messages.
